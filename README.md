## Architecture (Clean Architecture)
Clean architecture in a Flutter project ensures that the application's design is scalable, maintainable, and testable by separating concerns into distinct layers. This architectural pattern divides the project into four main layers: presentation, domain, data, and external. The presentation layer handles the user interface and user interactions, ensuring a clean separation from the business logic. The domain layer contains the core business logic, use cases, and entities, making it independent of any specific framework. The data layer manages data sources, repositories, and data transfer objects, facilitating the communication between the domain and external layers, which include API services, databases, and third-party libraries. By adhering to clean architecture principles, developers can achieve a high degree of modularity, making it easier to manage dependencies, perform unit testing, and adapt to changes in requirements without affecting other parts of the system. This approach promotes a robust and flexible codebase, essential for long-term project sustainability and team collaboration.

## Dependency Injection (get_it)
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dd6cb7c-ed6c-49b7-92c7-b0546c493ee0)
 > The get_it package in Flutter is a simple and efficient service locator that helps manage dependencies and implement dependency injection in your Flutter projects. This package allows you to register and retrieve instances of your classes, promoting loose coupling and making your code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
